LeetCode Problem 100: Same Tree
Problem Number: 100
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4

Topics: Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree
Time Complexity: O(min(n, m)) - where n and m are the number of nodes in the trees
Space Complexity: O(min(h1, h2)) - for the recursion stack
