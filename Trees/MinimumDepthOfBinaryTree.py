LeetCode Problem 111: Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Problem Number: 111
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path
from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^5].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Topics: Tree, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree
Time Complexity: O(n) - visit each node once
Space Complexity: O(w) - where w is the maximum width of the tree
