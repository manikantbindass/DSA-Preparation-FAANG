/*
 * LeetCode Problem 1380: Number of Closed Islands
 * Problem Number: 1380
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/
 *
 * Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal
 * 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally
 * (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.
 *
 * Return the number of closed islands.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: grid =
 * [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water
 * (group of 1s).
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
 * [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 * [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
 * [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
 * [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
 * [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 * [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
 * 	0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
 * - 0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
 *
 * Topics: Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union-Find, Matrix
 * Time Complexity: See solution
 * Space Complexity: O(1) to O(n)
