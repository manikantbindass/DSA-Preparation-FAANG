/*
 * LeetCode Problem 977: Distinct Subsequences II
 * Problem Number: 977
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/
 *
 * Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s.
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
 * string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
 * relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of
 * "abcde" while "aec" is not.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abc"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc",
 * and "abc".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "aba"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and
 * "aba".
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "aaa"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 2000
 * 	s consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "abc"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "aba"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "aaa"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= s.length <= 2000
 * - s consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Topics: String, Dynamic Programming
 * Time Complexity: O(n²) typical DP
 * Space Complexity: O(n) or O(n²)
