 * LeetCode Problem 263: Ugly Number
 * Problem Number: 263
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/
 *
 * An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other
 * than 2, 3, and 5.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 6 = 2 &times; 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 14
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	-231 <= n <= 231 - 1
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 6 = 2 &times; 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: n = 14
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 231 <= n <= 231 - 1
 *
 * Topics: Math
 * Time Complexity: See solution
 * Space Complexity: O(1) to O(n)
